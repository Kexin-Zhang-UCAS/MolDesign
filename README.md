# Introduction
This is a long-term support AI & simulation based project for molecule design, including inverse molcule generation and molcule properties prediction.
# model
The `model` contains up-to-date ML and DL models including LM(languidge model), GM(graph model), RL(reinforce learning), etc.
# utils
`utils` contains pre & post data procession tools
# instance
`instance` contains molecule/structure designing examples. 
# TODO
After impletement of one simple instance and one complete workflow for polymer, I will add it to `pypi`.
